guidelines: |
  When analyzing mobile app mockups, focus on:
  1. Touch-friendly UI elements (minimum 44x44pt tap targets)
  2. Native platform patterns (iOS vs Android)
  3. Gesture interactions (swipe, long-press, pinch-to-zoom)
  4. Bottom sheet and modal patterns
  5. Offline-first considerations
  6. Push notifications
  7. Device-specific features (camera, location, etc.)
  8. Responsive layouts for different screen sizes
